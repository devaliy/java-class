    //Operators in Java

    
    //1. Arithemtic Operators
    // + which is used for Addition
    // - which is usewd for Subtraction
    // * which is used for multiplication
    // (/) which is used for Division
    // % Whcih is used for Modulus(Remainder)


    //2. Assignment Operators
    // =  which is used to Assign a=5
    // += which is Add and Assign  a +=5 is the same as a = a + 5
    // -= which is Subtract and Assign a -=5 is the same as a =a -5
    // *= which is to Multiply and Assign a *=5 is the same as a = a * 5
    // /= which is to Divide and Assign a /=5 is the same as a = a /5
    // %= ehich is to Modulus and Assign a %=5 is the same as a = a % 5


    // 3 Relational Operators (Comparison Opertors)
    // == Equal to exmaple: a == b 
    // "!=" Not Equal to example a != 3
    // > Greater than example a > b
    // < Less than example b<a
    // >= Greater than or Equal a >= b
    // <= Less than or Equal  example b<= a

    // 4 Logic Operators
    // && Logical AND a > 0 && b > 0
    // "!" Logic NOT !(a>0)

    // 5 Unary Operators
    // ++ Increment (pre/post) ++a, a++
    // -- Decrement (_pre/post) --a, a--

    // 6 Bitwise Operators

    // & Bitwise AND a & b
    // ` Bitwise OR  a`b
    
    // Ternary Operator 
    // "?;" Ternary Condition result = (a>b) ? a : b
